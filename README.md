# Svelte-Kit + PayloadCMS + tRPC Turborepo

TurboRepo starter based on the awesome [HanielU/sk-trpc-payload](https://github.com/HanielU/sk-trpc-payload.git),
with some extras like project converted to *nix, removed all windowns references, opted to don't use `dun` and `replacer` binaries,
added `Dockerfile`'s for TurboRepo `server` and `web` packages, `docker-compose.yml` files, and added Caddy reverse proxy files, and other stuff
