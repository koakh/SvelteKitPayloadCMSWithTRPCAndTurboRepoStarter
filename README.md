# Svelte-Kit + PayloadCMS + tRPC Turborepo

This is an custom made Turborepo starter based on the awesome [HanielU/sk-trpc-payload](https://github.com/HanielU/sk-trpc-payload.git), with some extras like project converted to *nix project, removed all windowns references, opted to don't use dun and replacer binaries, and added Dockerfile's for turborepo server and web packages, docker-compose.yml files, and Caddy reverse procy files
